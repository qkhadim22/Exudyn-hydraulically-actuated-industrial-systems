# PatuCrane_Exudyn
This file includes the simulation of hydraulically actuated rigid multibody crane (PATU655 crane) in Exudyn environment 
#using redundtant and minimal coordinates. The details about rigid bodies and hydraulics in the crane can be found in 
#PatuNotes.pdf.  

# Installation
Install Exudyn software for running PatuCrane_Exudyn.py using the instructions https://exudyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/RST/InstallationInstructions.html.
